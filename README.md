# Chrome Extension Popup Permission Request Test

I am seeing the permissions dialog fail to show up in extension popups in some Chrome versions.

Fails on:

- Mac OSX 10.14.6
- Chrome Version 76.0.3809.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)

Works on:

- Mac OSX 10.14.6
- Chrome Version 78.0.3887.0 (Official Build) canary (64-bit)
